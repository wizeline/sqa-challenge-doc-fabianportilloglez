### **Type of Design Pattern**

Think in the best design pattern that better fits with Cypress in case that POM is not.

### **Save CSS locators**

Consider next time if save locators in fixture folder for each navigation page is the best option or maybe consider storing them in its pages.

### **Scenario Outline and Data tables**

Consider to take more advantage of those both features that cucumber provide us. 
### **Project structure**

Ask myself if having *src/frontend/cypress* is the best option considering that will be integrated in CICD pipeline as scripts and could be difficult the paths.

### **ESLint**

Not sure if the configuration I did for ESLint was the most appropriated or could be better. 

### **Javascript**

Is necessary master Javascript if I want to do a great job in automation because if not I wil be very limited to just using Cypress functionalities.

### **Assertions**

Consider in future to validate with API testing besides the frontend validations to make sure that is really working as expected.

### **Reports**

Mochareports are a good idea but can fail many times so I think that could be better to create own custom configuration for reports.
