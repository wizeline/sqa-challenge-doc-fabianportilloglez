## **Performance project**

### **Performance Testing Stage will try to cover as much of the following:**
1. Setup a Performance Testing Tool that work along with your project i.e. *Artillery *K6
2. Over the API Requests configured in Postman Collection (Headers, Payload, Authorization Token)
3. Define a load phase that last at least 60 seconds with 50 new users per second
4. Gather the metrics such as
    1. Min Latency Time
    2. Max Latency Time
    3. Error rate
    4. Success rate
5. Repeat the step 2 but now with 75 new users per second (Arrival Rate) and compare the metrics of two results.
