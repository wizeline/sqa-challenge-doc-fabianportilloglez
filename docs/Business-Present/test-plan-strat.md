**Scope, objectives, approach and risks**

**Test Basis** (use cases, diagrams, GTR, source code, data model, business processes)

**Scheduling of internal test activities** (analysis, design, implementation, execution)

**Entry Criteria and Exit Criteria**

**Entry Criteria:**

*	Availability of:
* testable requirements, user stories, and/or models (e.g., when following a model based testing strategy) 
*	test items that have met the exit criteria for any prior test levels
*	test environment 
*	necessary test tools 
*	test data and other necessary resources

**Exit Criteria:**

*	Planned tests have been executed 
*	A defined level of coverage (e.g., of requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, risks, code) has been achieved 
*	The number of unresolved defects is within an agreed limit 
*	The number of estimated remaining defects is sufficiently low 
*	The evaluated levels of reliability, performance efficiency, usability, security, and other relevant quality characteristics are sufficient

**Test Strategy:**
 
Manual vs Automated.

*	Candidates to be automated:
*	repetitive tasks
*	types of regression tests:
*	sanity
*	smoke
*	confirmation
*	regression
*	tests that use same workflow but different data
*	Tests that are prone to human error

**Test Design Techniques:**

**White Box:**

**Static code analysis**

*	Predefined patterns	
*	Machine learning analysis
*	Unit tests
*	Linting tools:
*	External tools: 	

**SonarQube:**

*	Code smells
*	Technical debt
*	Vulnerabilities
*	Size (files, classes, methodsâ€¦)
*	Comments
*	Complexity:
*	Cyclomatic complexity
*	Cognitive complexity

**Black Box:**
Categories:

1. Functional 
2. Non functional 
3. Regression

**Types of techniques:**

1. Equivalence Partitioning
2. Boundary Value Analysis
3. Decision Table Testing
4. Error guessing
