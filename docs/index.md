## **Introduction**

This is the documentation made by **Fabian Portillo Gonzalez** *(@fabianpg95 github username)* on the proposed **SQA challenge** in order to gain experience in the technical and soft skills along the process of this challenge.

This site was made using *Mkdocs* as static site and *markdown* as a written language with the purpose of having the different sections documented in a more understandable and isolated way such as the definition of objectives of the challenge, the **Back End**, **Front End**, and **Performance** sections besides a technical **diagram** showing the different components as part of the application.
